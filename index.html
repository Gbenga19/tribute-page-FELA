            <h2>Here's a time line of Fela Anikulapo Kuti Life:</h2>
            
            <ul>
         <li>  <Strong>In 1938,</Strong> Fela was born to the family of Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti  on 15 October 1938 in
Abeokuta, the modern-day capital of Ogun State in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, then a city in the British Colony of Nigeria, into an
upper-middle-class family. </li> <br>
<li>
<strong>In 1967,</strong> Fela went to Ghana to think up a new musical direction. That was when Kuti first called his music Afrobeat a combination of highlife, funk, jazz, salsa, calypso and traditional Nigerian Yoruba music. 
</li>         
<br>
<li>
         <strong>In 1977,</strong>Fela and the Afrika '70 released the album Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian military [ citation needed ]. The album was a smash hit and infuriated the government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta Republic, during which one thousand soldiers attacked the commune.
</li>
         <br>
<li>
<strong>In 1984,</strong>Muhammadu Buhari's government, of which Kuti was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency smuggling which Amnesty International and others denounced as politically motivated. 
</li>
<br>
<li>
<strong>In 1997,</strong>On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former
Minister of Health, announced his younger brother's death a day earlier from complications related to AIDS.
</li>
            </ul>
<br>
<blockquote><p><i>
"Since his death in 1997, there has been a revival of his influence in music and popular culture, culminating in another re-release of his catalog controlled by Universal Music, Broadway and off-Broadway biographically based shows, and new bands, such as
Antibalas, who carry the Afrobeat banner to a new generation of listeners." </i></p>
